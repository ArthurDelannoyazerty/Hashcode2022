# Hashcode2022

This is the work made by a part of the team "ESEO Rage" during the 2022 Hascode competition.

The programm was made in Java with OOP.

We did not complete the algorithm and the extraction of the .txt file was almost done.
We had a valid algorithm but we did not have the time to code it during the competition.

I will maybe complete the code in another branch "After Competition" in a near future.

This is not worth downloading it.
